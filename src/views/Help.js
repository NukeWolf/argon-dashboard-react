                <h3>How are tutors incentivized to join Tuut?</h3>

                <p>
                  Tutors set their own hourly wages, with the cap determined by
                  their experience (# of sessions) and ratings.
                </p>

                <h3>How can FGLI students access Tuut?</h3>
                <p>
                  TuutÂ® connects with university systems to reimburse low
                  income students for their lessons, ensuring that we
                  can help all students of all financial backgrounds. Please click on
                  our 'partner schools' sidebar option to see if your university is 
                  partnered with us. You can also shoot us a partner request to
                  put your university on our radar for future partnerships.
                </p>

                <h3>What separates Tuut from other tutoring platforms?</h3>
                <p>
                  Flexibility of time slots. Promptness of academic support.
                  Accessibility to students of all economic backgrounds. Code of
                  conduct to ensure academic integrity, and a safe and welcoming
                  environment.
